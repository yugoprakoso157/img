/**
 * @mainpage OJS API Reference
 *
 * Welcome to the OJS API Reference. This resource contains documentation
 * generated automatically from the OJS source code.
 *
 * The design of Open %Journal Systems 2.x is heavily structured for
 * maintainability, flexibility and robustness. Those familiar with Sun's
 * Enterprise Java Beans technology or the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
 * will note similarities.
 *
 * As in a MVC structure, data storage and representation, user interface
 * presentation, and control are separated into different layers. The major
 * categories, roughly ordered from "front-end" to "back-end," follow:
 * - Smarty templates, which are responsible for assembling HTML pages to
 *   display to users;
 * - Page classes, which receive requests from users' web browsers, delegate
 *   any required processing to various other classes, and call up the
 *   appropriate Smarty template to generate a response;
 * - Controllers, which implement reusable pieces of content e.g. for AJAX
 *   subrequests.
 * - Action classes, which are used by the Page classes to perform non-trivial
 *   processing of user requests;
 * - Model classes, which implement PHP objects representing the system's
 *   various entities, such as Users, Articles, and Journals;
 * - Data Access Objects (DAOs), which generally provide (amongst others)
 *   update, create, and delete functions for their associated Model classes,
 *   are responsible for all database interaction;
 * - Support classes, which provide core functionalities, miscellaneous common;
 *
 * Additionally, many of the concerns shared by multiple PKP applications are
 * implemented in the shared "pkp-lib" library, shipped in the lib/pkp
 * subdirectory. The same conventions listed above apply to lib/pkp as well.
 *
 * As the system makes use of inheritance and has consistent class naming
 * conventions, it is generally easy to tell what category a particular class
 * falls into.
 *
 * For example, a Data Access Object class always inherits from the DAO class,
 * has a Class name of the form [Something]%DAO, and has a filename of the form
 * [Something]%DAO.inc.php.
 *
 * To learn more about developing OJS, there are several additional resources
 * that may be useful:
 * - The docs/README document
 * - The PKP support forum at http://forum.pkp.sfu.ca
 * - Documentation available at http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_documentation
